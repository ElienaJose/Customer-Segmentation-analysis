Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project involves customer segmentation using clustering techniques to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. 
The goal is to help businesses better understand customer groups and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

Project Overview
Customer Segmentation Analysis aims to group customers into clusters based on various features such as age, income, spending score, membership years, and purchasing behavior. 
These clusters can help businesses identify distinct customer profiles like "Frequent Shoppers" or "High Spenders" to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer experience,
and boost sales.

Data Description
The dataset contains the following features:
Id : Customer ID
Age: Customer's age
Income: Annual income of the customer
Spending Score: Customer's spending behavior score
Membership Years: Number of years the customer has been a member
Purchase Frequency: How often the customer makes purchases
Preferred Category : Most preferred category that the customer purchases.
Last Purchase Amount: Amount spent in the last purchase

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data processing
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

Libraries:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and handle any missing values.
Feature Scaling: Standardize the features for better performance of clustering algorithms.
Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means.
Cluster Evaluation: Use silhouette analysis and other metrics to validate cluster quality.
Cluster Labeling: Assign descriptive names to each cluster based on their characteristics.
Visualization: Create plots to understand the distribution and characteristics of clusters.

Clustering Techniques
The project utilizes the following clustering techniques:

K-Means Clustering: To partition customers into groups based on the given features.
Silhouette Analysis: To evaluate the quality of clustering and determine the optimal number of clusters.

Results
The clustering analysis resulted in three distinct customer segments:

Cluster 0: Moderate spenders, average income, and consistent purchasing frequency.
Cluster 1: High spenders, slightly higher income, and longer membership duration.
Cluster 2: Younger customers with higher purchase frequency but lower spending amounts.

Silhouette Analysis
Silhouette analysis was performed to validate the quality of the clusters. The average silhouette score improved after dropping the "preferred category" feature, 
indicating more well-defined clusters.

Cluster Labeling
Based on the characteristics of each cluster:

Cluster 0: "Average Spenders" - Customers with moderate spending and average income.
Cluster 1: "High Spenders" - Customers with higher spending, older age, and longer membership.
Cluster 2: "Frequent Buyers" - Younger customers with high purchase frequency but lower spending amounts.

Conclusion
The customer segmentation analysis provides insights into customer behavior, helping businesses to:

Tailor marketing strategies
Improve customer retention
Optimize sales campaigns
